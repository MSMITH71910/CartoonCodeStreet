function generateClassicalBoardGameMusic() {
  /*
  This function would generate a classical-style melody suitable for board games like chess
  - Uses a more structured sequence of notes
  - Regular rhythm with clear time signature
  - Clean instrument sounds like piano or strings
  */
  
  // Implementation would use Web Audio API to generate:
  // 1. A main melody line with classical progression
  // 2. Supporting harmony in lower registers
  // 3. Regular rhythmic pattern with 4/4 time signature
  // 4. Export as MP3 to board-game.mp3
}

function generateFountainAmbientMusic() {
  /*
  This function would generate water-themed ambient music for the fountain
  - Flowing, continuous sounds with water-like textures
  - Minimal percussive elements
  - Gentle harmonic progression with long sustained notes
  - Subtle random elements to simulate water movement
  */
  
  // Implementation would use Web Audio API to generate:
  // 1. White noise filtered to sound like water
  // 2. Harmonic pads with slow attack and release
  // 3. Occasional bell-like tones reminiscent of water droplets
  // 4. Export as MP3 to fountain.mp3

function generateSeesawPlaygroundMusic() {

  This function would generate playful, bouncy music for the seesaw
  - Fast tempo with irregular accents
  - Bright, cheerful instrument sounds
  - Playful melody with wide pitch range
  - Exaggerated dynamics
  */
  
  // Implementation would use Web Audio API to generate:
  // 1. Main bouncy melody with staccato articulation
  // 2. Rhythmic percussion with emphasis on off-beats
  // 3. Occasional sound effects like squeaks or bounces
  // 4. Export as MP3 to playground.mp3
}
