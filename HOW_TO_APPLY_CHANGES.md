# How to Apply Your Changes

After editing the project information in the data file, follow these steps to see your changes:

## Method 1: Automatic Refresh (Usually Works)

1. Save the changes to `client/src/lib/data/projects.ts`
2. The application should automatically detect the changes and refresh

## Method 2: Manual Restart (If Automatic Refresh Doesn't Work)

1. Save the changes to `client/src/lib/data/projects.ts`
2. Click the "Stop" button in the Replit interface (the square icon)
3. Click the "Run" button in the Replit interface (the play icon)
4. Wait for the application to restart (this may take a few seconds)
5. Once restarted, the changes should be visible

## Verifying Your Changes

1. Check if the house signs display your updated project names
2. Click on the houses to make sure the popup content is updated 
3. Test the "View Live Site" and "GitHub" buttons to ensure they link to your URLs

## Troubleshooting

If your changes aren't showing up:

1. Check for any syntax errors in the project data file
2. Make sure your URLs include "http://" or "https://" at the beginning
3. Try Method 2 (Manual Restart) if Method 1 doesn't work
4. If that doesn't work, try refreshing your browser
